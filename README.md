# Machine_Learning_in_Asset_Pricing_Review

The project consists of a review of the main Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts, methodologies, modeles, and applications (papers) in Empirical Asset Pricing, as well as links to datasets, researcher's page, videos of presentations, and so on.

The repository contains a markdown file and all the necessary corollary files(images, screenshots, cls, bibliography, ...).
The paths used in the markdown cell to index the figures and images must be change by the user.
The markdown file can be nicely rendered as html or pdf using pandoc
