# ML AND DL CONCEPTS OVERVIEWS

In this chapter only the concepts relevant for Asset Pricing (AP) are discussed. For instance, the whole general class of classification problems or unsupervised learning are not treated as the goal in (AP) is to explain/predict prices and returns which are both continues variables instead of classes.

### INFORMATION CRITERIA



One approach to select the best model is to compare them using the information criteria

### CROSS-VALIDATION (CV)

However the more robust solution is to use the Cross-validation (CV) approach

####  PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS (PCA)

N are the observations and P are the features. Geometrically the NxP matrix consists in N points in a P dimensional space. PCA reduces the dimensional space from P to K and represents the N obsrvations as points in this K dimensional space. The axes (space basis) of the P dimensional space are defined by the columns of the NxP matrix (each axis is a vector defined by N coordinates, therefore in a N dimensional space).

![](G:\My Drive\PhD\Research\Studying and Reviews\ML and DL in Asset Pricing\writing\images\image-20211027174206407.png)

$V_{k}$ represents the loadings (k values shared by all the N observations) of the P dimensions on the k-th PCA dimension. It tells how to project the P dimensions onto the k-th PCA dimension

$Z_{k}$ is Nx1

#### REGRESSION TREES



These series of slides are from Long Feng - SDSC 6001–Statistical Machine Learning, Spring 2020 - School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong

In this section only the regression tree are covered as the classification trees are usually not relevant in asset pricing since the studied dataset consists of asset prices or retursn which are indeed not classes but continues variables instead.

##### ECONOMETRIC MODEL - KPS 2020 [@IPCA_econometrics]

In this section the original model developed in @IPCA_econometrics in 2018 (working paper updated in 2020) is presented. The working paper originally did not have an asset pricing application, which it has been indeed developed in @IPCA.

### GLOBAL FACTOR DATA (Brian Kelly)

The factor portfolio return data below is for the 153 factors in 93 countries studied in* ["Is There A Replication Crisis In Finance?"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3774514)* by Jensen, Kelly, and Pedersen (2021). For researchers with a WRDS license, we provide SAS code to run on WRDS that produces all stock-level signals for a larger collection of 406 characteristics (and the associated factor portfolios) in 93 countries.
